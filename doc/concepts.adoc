== Concepts

MicroProfile Reactive Messaging proposes a model to build data streaming application using a CDI development model. It
is based on 3 main concepts:

* `Message`
* `@Incoming`
* `@Outgoing`

Behind the scene, SmallRye Reactive Streams composes _Reactive Streams_ and ensures the consistent flow of messages.

=== Messages

A `Message` (defined by `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Message`) is an envelope around a payload. The
`Message` interface just offers a way to retrieve the payload (`getPayload`), a set of _headers_ and a method to acknowledge the message (`ack`).

The `Message` interface is parameterized with the type of the payload. For example, `Message<String>` describes a
message containing a `String` payload.

A `Message` can contain headers, i.e. a set of metadata attached to the message. These headers can be used to:

1. retrieve metadata about the message, like for example the Kafka topic,
2. add data propagated with the message that may influence the outbound dispatching, for example indicate to which Kafka topic the message should be written.

The interface can be subclassed by the user or by transport layers to propose more methods. For example, a `Message`
coming from Kafka can propose methods to retrieve the Kafka related metadata.

Acknowledgement is covered below, in a dedicated section.

=== Incoming

`Incoming` is an annotation indicating that the method consumes a stream. The name of the stream is given as attribute
such as in:

```java
@Incoming("my-stream")
public void consume(Message<String> s) {
  // ...
}
```

A method only annotated with `@Incoming` forms the end of a processing chain, often called _sink_:

=== Outgoing

`Outgoing` is an annotation indicating that the method feeds a stream. The name of the stream is given as attribute:

```java
@Outgoing("my-stream")
public Message<String> produce() {
  // ...
}
```

A method only annotated with `@Outgoing` is a sort of data _source_:

=== Methods with @Outgoing and @Incoming

Of course, methods can also use both annotations to transform the incoming messages:

```java
@Incoming("from")
@Outgoing("to")
public String toUpperCase(String input) {
  return input.toUpperCase();
}
```

A method annotated with both annotation is generally called _processor_ or _mediator_:

=== Binding matching @Outgoing to @Incoming

SmallRye Reactive Messaging automatically binds matching `@Outgoing` to `@Incoming` to form a chain:

Methods annotated with `@Incoming` or `@Outgoing` don't have to be in the same _bean_ (_class_). You can distribute them
amount a set of beans. Remote interactions are possible using a _transport_ layer. This topic is covered in another
section.

=== Headers and Propagation

Each message has a set of headers (potentially empty).
These headers are retrieved with `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Message.getHeaders`.
The header set is an instance of `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Headers` which can be seen as an immutable `Map<String, Object>`.
Neither the key or value can be `null`.

To add headers to a message, you can either use:

1. `Message.of(payload, headers, ack)` or `Message.of(payload, headers)`
2. Use an existing `Message` and call `withHeaders(headers)`. This method copies the payload and ack into another instance of `Message`.

To create a set of `Headers` use: `Headers.of(...)` or `Headers.builder()` returning a builder.

Headers are propagated though the chain when your method receives a single _payloads_.
In all the other cases (stream, receiving `Message` and not payload), you need to propagate the headers yourself, for example, using `message.withHeaders(incoming.getHeaders())`.
