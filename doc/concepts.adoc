== Concepts

MicroProfile Reactive Messaging proposes a model to build data streaming application using a CDI development model. It
is based on 3 main concepts:

* `Message`
* `@Incoming`
* `@Outgoing`

Behind the scene, SmallRye Reactive Streams composes _Reactive Streams_ and ensures the consistent flow of messages.

=== Messages

A `Message` (defined by `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Message`) is an envelope around a payload. The
`Message` interface just offers a way to retrieve the payload (`getPayload`), a set of _metadata_ and a method to acknowledge the message (`ack`).

The `Message` interface is parameterized with the type of the payload. For example, `Message<String>` describes a
message containing a `String` payload.

A `Message` can contain metadata. These metadata can be used to:

1. retrieve details about the message, like for example the Kafka topic, Kafka key, HTTP headers...;
2. add data propagated with the message that may influence the outbound dispatching, for example indicate to which Kafka topic the message should be written to.

Acknowledgement is covered below, in a dedicated section.

=== Incoming

`Incoming` is an annotation indicating that the method consumes a stream. The name of the stream is given as attribute
such as in:

```java
@Incoming("my-stream")
public void consume(Message<String> s) {
  // ...
}
```

A method only annotated with `@Incoming` forms the end of a processing chain, often called _sink_:

=== Outgoing

`Outgoing` is an annotation indicating that the method feeds a stream. The name of the stream is given as attribute:

```java
@Outgoing("my-stream")
public Message<String> produce() {
  // ...
}
```

A method only annotated with `@Outgoing` is a sort of data _source_:

image::outgoing.png[align="center"]

=== Methods with @Outgoing and @Incoming

Of course, methods can also use both annotations to transform the incoming messages:

```java
@Incoming("from")
@Outgoing("to")
public String toUpperCase(String input) {
  return input.toUpperCase();
}
```

A method annotated with both annotation is generally called _processor_ or _mediator_:

image::processor.png[align="center"]

=== Binding matching @Outgoing to @Incoming

SmallRye Reactive Messaging automatically binds matching `@Outgoing` to `@Incoming` to form a chain:

image::chain.png[align="center"]

Methods annotated with `@Incoming` or `@Outgoing` don't have to be in the same _bean_ (_class_). You can distribute them
amount a set of beans. Remote interactions are possible using a _transport_ layer. This topic is covered in another
section.

=== Metadata and Propagation

Each message has a set of metadata (potentially empty).
These metadata are retrieved with `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Message.getMetadata`.
The metadata set is an instance of `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Metadata` which can be seen as an immutable `Map<String, Object>`.
Neither the key or value can be `null`.

To add metadata to a message, you can either use:

1. `Message.of(payload, metadata, ack)` or `Message.of(payload, metadata)`
2. Use an existing `Message` and call `withMetadata(metadata)`. This method copies the payload and ack into another instance of `Message`.

To create a set of `Metadata` use: `Metadata.of(...)` or `Metadata.builder()` returning a builder.

Metadata are propagated though the chain when your method receives a single _payloads_.
In all the other cases (stream, receiving `Message` and not payload), you need to propagate the metadata yourself, for example, using `message.withMetadata(incoming.getMetadata())`.
